# Interview Problem

 The following tasks assess ability to manage data files effectively.
 While the tasks may seem simple, a strong emphasis will be placed on code reusability and readability.
 
 - Using comments note any assumptions made, improvements noted etc.

## Tasks
1. Using the language of your choice, read the `data.json` file, and print the top-level keys to __stderr__.
2. Having read the file, write the data to a series of csv files, each one named `<key>.csv` where `key` is the top-level key in the json data. Each sub-key should represent a column in the relevant csv file.
3. Design a SQL schema to store the data, and save the data in a database.
4. Write a simple web front-end which accesses the database and displays the requested data.
